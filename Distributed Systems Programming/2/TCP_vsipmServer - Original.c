/*
300115 Distributed systems and Programming: TCP_vsipmServer.c

Compile with: cc TCP_vsipmServer.c -o lec3_server


A simple concurrent connection orientated server.
Will work with telnet as a client.

You should specify the server port number as the last four digits of your
student nubmer (as long as it is above 1024 add 1024 if it is not). This
should minimise server port number clashes with other students sharing
 the machine.
 
Note: there is minimal error checking in this example, in order to improve
its readability. Production quality code would be filled with error
checking and recovery code to make it as robust as possible. Real code
doesn't "bail out" at the first sign of an error.
